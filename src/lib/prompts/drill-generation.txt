Generate a {target_language} {grammar_concept} practice file in the exact TSV format below. Your entire response must be only the TSV data without any additional text. Output must start with #META and end with the last practice sentence.

CRITICAL: Write natural, grammatically correct sentences FIRST, then identify which words demonstrate the grammar concept. NEVER work backwards from desired grammar forms to create forced or incorrect sentences.

DIFFICULTY GUIDELINES:
- Beginner: Simple sentences (5-8 words), common everyday vocabulary, explicit prompts with clear instructions
- Intermediate: Moderate sentences (8-15 words), varied vocabulary including less common words, context-based prompts
- Advanced: Complex sentences (15+ words), advanced vocabulary, idiomatic expressions, nuanced prompts requiring deeper grammatical understanding
- Expert: Sophisticated sentences with multiple clauses, academic/specialized vocabulary, minimal prompts requiring extensive knowledge

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Generate exactly {number_of_sentences} practice items.
2. MANDATORY: Create grammatically correct, natural sentences FIRST
3. MANDATORY: The target_word MUST appear exactly as written in the full_sentence
4. MANDATORY: All sentences must be authentic and sound natural to native speakers
5. MANDATORY: Include at least 7 different topics/scenarios (e.g., family, work, travel, food, nature, technology, culture).
6. MANDATORY: Vary sentence lengths - mix short (5-8 words), medium (9-15 words), and long (16+ words) sentences.
7. MANDATORY: Use different sentence types - statements, questions, commands, and subordinate clauses.
8. For intermediate to expert levels, include at least 20% sentences with idiomatic expressions or cultural context.
9. NEVER create grammatically incorrect sentences just to force a particular grammar form

PROMPT FIELD RULES (CRITICAL):
1. ALWAYS start with either "Fill in the blank with" or "Complete the sentence with"
2. ALWAYS specify if the answer should be singular or plural (e.g., "singular form", "plural form")
3. NEVER reveal the specific grammatical structure (e.g., don't say "accusative form" or "dative case")
4. NEVER include the target word or its variations in the prompt
5. Focus on providing just enough context to disambiguate without giving away the answer

PROMPT TEMPLATES BY DIFFICULTY:
- Beginner: "Fill in the blank with the [singular/plural] form of [base word]"
- Intermediate: "Complete the sentence with the correct [singular/plural] form"
- Advanced: "Fill in the blank with the appropriate [singular/plural] word"
- Expert: "Complete this sentence correctly (use [singular/plural] form)"

SENTENCE CREATION PROCESS (MANDATORY):
1. FIRST: Write a grammatically correct, natural sentence in the target language
2. SECOND: Identify which word in that sentence demonstrates the grammar concept
3. THIRD: Copy that word EXACTLY as it appears to become the target_word
4. FOURTH: Create an appropriate prompt that doesn't reveal the answer
5. NEVER work backwards from a desired case/form to force a sentence

VERIFICATION STEPS (CRITICAL - CHECK EVERY ROW):
1. Read the full_sentence aloud - is it grammatically correct and natural?
2. VERIFY the target_word appears EXACTLY character-for-character in the full_sentence
3. VERIFY you can remove the target_word and the sentence makes sense with a blank
4. VERIFY the prompt doesn't contain the target_word or reveal the specific grammatical structure
5. VERIFY the prompt specifies singular/plural where applicable
6. VERIFY sentence topic diversity - no more than 2 sentences on the same topic
7. For inflected languages: VERIFY the target_word is in the correct case/form for its role in the sentence

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
❌ Target word doesn't match what's actually in the sentence
❌ Grammatically incorrect sentences forced to demonstrate a concept
❌ Working backwards from desired grammar forms
❌ Prompts that reveal the answer (e.g., "dative form")
❌ Unnatural or forced sentence constructions

ALTERNATE_ANSWERS FIELD:
- Include all valid alternative answers, if any exist
- For verbs or nouns with accepted spelling variations, include both forms
- If contractions are possible, include both contracted and uncontracted forms

IMPROVED EXAMPLES:

CORRECT format (BEGINNER - Spanish):
Yo voy al supermercado todos los días.	voy	Fill in the blank with the singular form of "ir"	Present tense irregular verb conjugation		Remember that "ir" is irregular: yo voy, tú vas

CORRECT format (INTERMEDIATE - Czech):
Viděl jsem krásnou starou knihu na pultech antikvariátu.	krásnou starou knihu	Complete the sentence with the correct singular form	Accusative feminine singular		Feminine adjectives change endings in accusative

CORRECT format (ADVANCED - Czech):
V těch starých dopisech, které jsem našel v šuplíku, se často psalo o životě v malém městečku na hranicích.	městečku	Fill in the blank with the appropriate singular form	Locative case of neuter nouns		Consider which case follows "v" with location

TOPIC VARIATION REQUIREMENTS:
Must include sentences from at least 7 different domains:
- Daily life/routine
- Work/profession
- Travel/transportation
- Food/dining
- Family/relationships
- Nature/environment
- Culture/entertainment
- Technology/modern life
- Health/medicine
- Education/learning

Remember: Track all target words AND topics used to ensure NO REPETITION. Create sentences that feel natural and authentic to native speakers.
