## STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE SPECIFIC CONCEPT

Before creating questions, analyze what your grammar concept actually tests:

### **Verb Conjugation Concepts:**
- **"[Language] verb conjugation"**: Tests applying correct verb forms to given verbs
- **"Definite vs indefinite object conjugation" (Hungarian)**: Tests how VERBS change based on object definiteness (target = verb forms, not articles)
- **"Aspect pairs" (Slavic languages)**: Tests choosing between perfective/imperfective verb forms of the SAME verb
- **"Trilateral root conjugation" (Arabic)**: Tests applying person/tense/mood patterns to consonant roots

### **Choice Concepts:**
- **"Tense choice" (Present simple vs continuous)**: Tests WHEN to use each tense based on context
- **"Ser vs estar"**: Tests WHICH verb fits based on permanent vs temporary meaning
- **"Tone pairs" (Chinese/Vietnamese)**: Tests distinguishing between words that sound similar but have different tones
- **"Case choice" (Accusative vs dative)**: Tests WHICH case role fits the sentence structure

### **Inflection/Morphology Concepts:**
- **"[Case] declension"**: Tests applying correct endings to nouns for specific grammatical roles
- **"Vowel harmony" (Turkish/Finnish)**: Tests applying correct vowel patterns in suffixes
- **"Noun class agreement" (Bantu languages)**: Tests matching prefixes/suffixes across related words

### **Syntax/Structure Concepts:**
- **"Word order"**: Tests correct positioning of sentence elements
- **"Separable verbs" (Germanic)**: Tests where verb parts go in different clause types
- **"Question formation"**: Tests structural changes needed for interrogatives

## STEP 2: IDENTIFY THE CONCEPT CATEGORY AND STRATEGY

### **FOR INFLECTION/TRANSFORMATION CONCEPTS:**
- **Strategy**: Specify the word/root AND the grammatical context, let students determine the required form
- ✅ DO: "Conjugate the root 'ك-ت-ب' for this context"
- ✅ DO: "Decline 'muž' in the accusative case"
- ❌ DON'T: "Conjugate 'kataba' for masculine singular present tense" (too specific)

### **FOR CHOICE/SELECTION CONCEPTS:**
- **Strategy**: DON'T reveal which choice to make, but be specific about what type of choice
- ✅ DO: "Choose the appropriate aspect of 'číst'"
- ✅ DO: "Complete with the correct form of 'drink'"
- ✅ DO: "Choose the character with the correct tone"
- ❌ DON'T: "Use the perfective form" (gives away the choice)
- ❌ DON'T: "Complete with the correct word" (too vague)

### **FOR VOCABULARY/SEMANTIC CONCEPTS:**
- **Strategy**: Give meaning-based clues without being too specific
- ✅ DO: "Fill in with a word meaning 'quickly'"
- ✅ DO: "Complete this expression about weather"

### **FOR SYNTAX/STRUCTURAL CONCEPTS:**
- **Strategy**: Focus on structural relationships and positioning
- ✅ DO: "Complete the separable verb structure"
- ✅ DO: "Add the word that goes in second position"

## STEP 3: CREATE QUALITY CONTENT

### **Script and Writing System Requirements (CRITICAL):**
- **Target words MUST be in the target language's native script**
- **Japanese**: Use hiragana/katakana/kanji (で, を, に), NOT romanization (de, wo, ni)
- **Arabic**: Use Arabic script (يكتب, كتب), NOT transliteration (yaktubu, kataba)
- **Russian**: Use Cyrillic (читал, говорю), NOT Latin (chital, govoryu)
- **Chinese**: Use characters (买, 说), NOT pinyin (mai, shuo)
- **Greek**: Use Greek script (είμαι, έχω), NOT Latin transliteration
- Romanization can be included in alternate_answers field as additional option

### **Target Word Verification (CRITICAL):**
Your target words must actually test what the concept claims:
- **Verb conjugation concepts**: Target = VERB FORMS that show the conjugation pattern
- **Case concepts**: Target = DECLINED FORMS showing the case
- **Tone concepts**: Target = WORDS that demonstrate tone distinctions
- **Choice concepts**: Target = the element that varies based on the choice being tested

### **Natural Sentences with Variety:**
- Write authentic sentences that native speakers would actually say
- **Within each quiz, include variety in:**
  - Sentence structures (simple, complex, subordinate clauses, questions, imperatives)
  - Contexts and scenarios (work, family, travel, daily life, etc.)
  - Sub-concepts within the main grammar topic
  - Progressive complexity from easier to harder examples

### **Appropriate Hints by Concept Type:**
- **INFLECTION**: Morphological rules ("Accusative masculine animate adds -e")
- **CHOICE**: Selection criteria ("Use perfective for completed actions")
- **VOCABULARY**: Semantic guidance ("Formal word for 'begin'")
- **SYNTAX**: Structural rules ("Separable prefixes go to end in main clauses")
- **Vary hint content** - don't repeat identical hints across questions

### **Difficulty Calibration:**
- **Beginner**: Simple, regular cases with very explicit guidance
- **Intermediate**: Mix of regular/irregular with clear guidance
- **Advanced**: Complex cases with moderate guidance
- **Expert**: Exceptional cases with minimal guidance

## CONCEPT-SPECIFIC EXAMPLES:

### **INFLECTION (Czech declension):**
Viděl jsem muže na ulici.	muže	Decline "muž" in the accusative case	Accusative case		Masculine animate nouns add -e in accusative

### **CHOICE (Czech aspects):**
Včera jsem _____ celý román.	přečetl	Choose the appropriate aspect of "číst"	Perfective vs imperfective	četl	Consider whether action was completed

### **CHOICE (Japanese particles):**
私は毎日コーヒー____飲みます。	を	Choose the appropriate particle	Particle usage	が	Consider what role "コーヒー" plays in this sentence

### **CHOICE (Chinese tones):**
我想____这本书。	买	Choose the character with the correct tone	Tone pair choice	卖	Consider whether this is acquiring or selling

### **INFLECTION (Arabic conjugation):**
الطالب _____ الدرس.	يكتب	Conjugate the root "ك-ت-ب" for this context	Present tense conjugation		Third person masculine present uses prefix ي-

### **SYNTAX (German separable verbs - with variety):**
Ich _____ früh _____.	stehe...auf	Complete the separable verb structure	Main clause separable verbs		Separable prefixes go to end in main clauses
Ich weiß, dass er früh _____.	aufsteht	Complete the verb form	Subordinate clause verbs		Separable verbs stay together in subordinate clauses

## QUALITY VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
Before finalizing each question, verify:
1. **Concept alignment**: Does the target word actually test what the concept claims?
2. **Script correctness**: Is the target word in the correct writing system?
3. **Prompt strategy**: Does the prompt strategy match the concept type?
4. **Appropriate specificity**: Not too revealing (choice) or too vague (inflection)?
5. **Sentence naturalness**: Does the sentence sound natural?
6. **Target accuracy**: Does the target word appear exactly in the sentence?
7. **Quiz variety**: Are you including different structures/contexts within the concept?
8. **Hint variation**: Are hints varied and teaching actual grammar rules?
